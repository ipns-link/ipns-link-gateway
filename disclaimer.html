        <p><a href="https://github.com/ipns-link">IPNS-Link</a> consists of an exposer app, henceforth referred to as Exposer, and a web-portal, henceforth referred to as Gateway. The Gateway merely acts as a smart proxy and does not host anything by itself. Both the Exposer and the Gateway do not process any user data except the http request headers, and therefore remain agnostic of the contents of the website(s) being exposed and accessed using IPNS-Link. <br><br>

            IPNS-Link was conceived and is being maintained, with humanity's best interests in mind - ranging from freedom of speech, self-expression and sharing of valuable information under the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html">Fair-Use policy</a>. It is not meant to be misused for copyright infringing, illegal or criminal activities and blatantly unethical acts. On request, all public Gateway providers, following due diligence, may block offensive sites from being served through their respective Gateways. <br><br>
